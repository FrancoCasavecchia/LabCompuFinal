# Final Proyect:

The program that i am proposing is a web-based platform that allows users to interact with a canvas specifically designed for physics. The interactive canvas will consist of various tools that enable users to perform experiments, analyze data, and visualize results in real-time.

Some of the features that I plan to incorporate into the program include a tool for creating simulations.The simulation tool will allow users to create virtual experiments and observe the results.

In addition to these features, the program will also have a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and use the various tools. 

Overall, our program will provide a valuable resource for students and educators alike, allowing them to explore physics concepts and perform experiments in a fun and interactive way. 

Some specific topics in physics that could be explored using our proposed web-based platform include mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, and quantum mechanics. The platform could provide tools for simulating and visualizing phenomena related to these topics, as well as tools for analyzing and interpreting data from real-world experiments.

The topic I would explain with the canva is:
    [Temperature And Pressure](/extraReadMe/TemperatureAndPressure.md) showing the relationship between temperature and pressure in any kind of gas, such as helium, nitrogen, oxygen , etc. This would allow users to compare the behavior of different gases under different conditions(Temperature and Pressure) and see how their properties affect their behavior.
    
Apart of the interactive canva the project have an explanation of the relationship of each different type of gas with the temperature and pressure.
