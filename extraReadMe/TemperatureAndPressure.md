# Temperature and Pressure

The behavior of different types of gases is affected by their properties, such as their molecular weight and the strength of their intermolecular forces. As temperature and pressure change, these properties can cause the gases to behave differently. For example, as temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules also increases, causing the gas to expand and exert more pressure on its surroundings. Similarly, as pressure increases, the molecules of a gas are forced closer together, which can lead to changes in their behavior. Understanding how temperature and pressure affect different types of gases is important for many areas of science and engineering, including the design of engines and the study of atmospheric phenomena.

In the program will not be so specific about the real action in the gas but it is going to be illustrative and useful.

The differents kinds of gasses are going to use are:
- Helium
- Neon
- Argon
- Krypton
- Xenon
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Hydrogen
- Carbon dioxide
- Methane

And the explanation of each gas will appear below the proyect explanation.
